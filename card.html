                <p class="wolf-fact"> wolves (also known as the white wolf or polar wolf) are a sub-species of grey wolves.
                     They spend their lives in the Arctic tundra, higher than the northern tree line. 
                     They are the only wolf in the world with their coloring, 
                    unique due to the environment where they live.

                    <p class="wolf-description"> The white wolf is among the most unique animals
                        in general and wolves in particular for its
                        characteristics and the unusual features that 
                        can be found in it. The white wolf is scientifically 
                        known as the arctic wolf and is also referred to as 
                        the Melville Island wolf to be named after the island on
                        which it lives. The arctic wolf is considered to be a possible 
                        subspecies of gray wolf. The area in which the arctic wolf lives 
                        extends from the Melville Island to Ellesmere Island that are
                        located in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. 
                        There are different features that make the arctic or 
                        white wolf unique such as the white color and the 
                        small size as it has a medium-sized body that is 
                        smaller than the body of the northwestern wolf.
